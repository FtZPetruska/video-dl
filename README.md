## Downloads

The .zip for Windows is available in the [releases](https://github.com/Kenshin9977/video-dl-script/releases) section.

## Usage

Launch `scripts/video_dl.bat` (Windows) or `scripts/video_dl.sh` (Linux/Mac), enter the URL of a video, select start and end time then close the window when finished or enter another URL. The files are downloaded in the `downloads/` folder.
You can skip the start and end time part by changing the value in config/config.ini from false to true. It's useful if you always want to get the whole video.
